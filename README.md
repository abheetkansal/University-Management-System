# My Personal Project

## University Management System

- **What will the application do?**

    This application is designed to help the students and teachers of the *University of Techno Lords* in a plethora
of ways. It will allow the teachers to enter a new student's data, enter student's grades, view student's Grade Sheet, 
and calculate student's percentage as well. For the students, this application would allow them to view their details,
view their grade sheet, calculate their percentage, and most importantly, students can check their majors as well.
Moreover, to protect the data of students and teachers, a student or teacher can only check their details with their 
unique student ID or unique teacher ID respectively.


- **Who will use it?**

    This application would be used by the students and teachers of the *University of Techno Lords*.

   **This application would help a Teacher to do the following:**
  - Add new students
  - Enter student's grades
  - View student's Grade Sheet
  - Calculate student percentage
  
  **This application would help a Student to do the following:**
  - View their details
  - View their Grade Sheet
  - Calculate their percentage
  - Check their major


- **Why is this project of interest to you?**

    This project is interesting and exciting for me because as a student I always wanted to make a University
Managements System which would help the Teachers to easily access the student's Grade Sheet and calculate their
percentage of the grades they got in their courses. Being a student, I always wanted to make a system which would 
display my Grade Sheet and then check my major based on my calculated percentage. Moreover, this project of University 
Management System would help to prevent the use of paper and everything will be stored digitally in a proper systematic 
manner where each student and teach has their unique ID to access their data.
